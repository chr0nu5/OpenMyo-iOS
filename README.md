# Open Myo client for iOS (iPhone only currently)

[Thalmic Myo](https://developer.thalmic.com/downloads) wearable lets us capture a lot of interesting data.
This project is about capturing it visualizing the data and sending it to be safely stored on a server.

The goal is to capture what you do and enable you see what is possible. Use your imagination, 
find patterns, debug issues with your Myo enabled applications, see how you personally use the myo. 
Tag streams of data to bring context to the numbers, where you Jogging? Talking? Boxing? Throwing a ball?
All are interesting individual samples, don't let them drown in a sea of averages.
